# üì± PWA Setup Guide for SkyLite Family Manager

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

Your Nuxt config has been updated with PWA support! The following is configured:

- ‚úÖ PWA module installed (`@vite-pwa/nuxt`)
- ‚úÖ Manifest configuration added to `nuxt.config.ts`
- ‚úÖ Service worker setup for offline support
- ‚úÖ Auto-update functionality
- ‚úÖ Caching strategies configured

## üé® Step 1: Generate PWA Icons

You need to create 4 icon files from your existing `public/skylite.svg`:

### Option A: Use Online Tool (Easiest) ‚≠ê

1. Go to: **https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator**
2. Upload `public/skylite.svg`
3. Download the generated icons
4. Extract and copy these 4 files to your `public/` directory:
   - `icon-192.png`
   - `icon-512.png`
   - `icon-maskable-192.png`
   - `icon-maskable-512.png`

### Option B: Use ImageMagick (If Available)

If you have sudo access, install ImageMagick and run the script:

```bash
sudo apt install imagemagick
./generate-pwa-icons.sh
```

### Option C: Manual Creation

Use any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, Figma, etc.):

**Regular Icons:**
- `icon-192.png`: 192x192px, transparent background
- `icon-512.png`: 512x512px, transparent background

**Maskable Icons** (with safe area padding):
- `icon-maskable-192.png`: 192x192px, cyan background (#06b6d4), icon centered with 20% padding
- `icon-maskable-512.png`: 512x512px, cyan background (#06b6d4), icon centered with 20% padding

> **Note:** Maskable icons ensure your icon looks good on all devices, especially Android 13+ which uses adaptive icons.

- Doesn't require HTTPS on local network

### Service Worker Not Registering

1. Clear browser cache
2. Check DevTools console for errors
3. Ensure icons exist in `public/` directory
4. Restart dev server

### App Not Working Offline

- Service worker needs time to cache assets
- Visit all pages once while online
- Check "Cache Storage" in DevTools

### Can't Access from Other Devices

1. Check firewall settings
2. Ensure devices are on same WiFi network
3. Try IP address instead of hostname
4. Port 3000 must be accessible
