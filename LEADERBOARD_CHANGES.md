```typescript
const rankedUsers = computed(() => {
  // Sort users by selected time period
  const sorted = [...users.value].sort((a, b) => {
    if (timePeriod === "today") return b.pointsToday - a.pointsToday;
    if (timePeriod === "week") return b.pointsThisWeek - a.pointsThisWeek;
    return b.points - a.points; // All time
  });
  
  // Add rank position
  return sorted.map((user, index) => ({
    ...user,
    rank: index + 1,
  }));
});
```

### **Medal System:**
- Rank 1 → 🥇
- Rank 2 → 🥈
- Rank 3 → 🥉
- Rank 4+ → #4, #5, etc.
