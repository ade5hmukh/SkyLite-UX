# About The Project

Skylite UX was conceived as an open source, self-hosted alternative to commercial family managers. Most commercial offerings require expensive hardware and include subscriptions. Our goal was to create an offering that allows you to bring your own hardware, avoid subscriptions, and subscription associated feature creep while playing nicely with other self-hosted offerings.

## Features

- Docker Deployment
- Family Calendar
- Task Lists
- Meal Planning
- User Management
